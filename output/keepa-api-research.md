# Keepa API Research — Endpoints, Extension Internals & Data Extraction

Last updated: 2026-04-13

---

## 1. Official API Base URL & Authentication

All official API calls go through a single base URL:

```
https://api.keepa.com/{path}?key={accessKey}&{params}
```

- **Authentication**: 64-character access key required for ALL endpoints
- **Protocol**: HTTPS only, GZIP responses, JSON format
- **HTTP Methods**: GET (default), POST (when `postData` is present)
- **User-Agent**: `KEEPA-JAVA Framework-{version}`
- **Timeouts**: 30s connect, 120s read

### Token System

- Tokens refill per-minute based on subscription tier
- Unused tokens expire after 60 minutes
- Every response includes: `tokensLeft`, `refillIn` (ms), `refillRate` (tokens/min), `tokensConsumed`
- `/token` endpoint: free check of remaining tokens (no token cost)
- Status 429 = NOT_ENOUGH_TOKEN, 402 = PAYMENT_REQUIRED

### Keepa Time Format

All timestamps use "Keepa Time Minutes" — minutes since January 1, 2011:
```
unix_epoch_ms = (keepa_minutes + 21564000) * 60000
// Alternatively: keepa_minutes = (unix_ms / 60000) - 21564000
```

Constant: `KEEPA_ST_ORDINAL` = January 1, 2011

Returns: `tokensLeft`, `refillIn`, `refillRate` — **consumes 0 tokens**.

---

## 3. Free/Public Endpoint: graph.keepa.com

This is the most significant finding for token-free data access:

```
https://graph.keepa.com/pricehistory.png?asin={ASIN}&domain={domain}&amazon=1&new=1&used=1&range=365
```

**This endpoint requires NO API key and NO authentication.**

**Parameters**:
| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `asin` | string | Product ASIN (required) |
| `domain` | string | Amazon TLD string: com, co.uk, de, fr, co.jp, ca, it, es, in, com.mx, com.br |
| `amazon` | 0\|1 | Show Amazon price |
| `new` | 0\|1 | Show New price |
| `used` | 0\|1 | Show Used price |
| `range` | int | Time range in days |

**Domain ID mapping** (for `api.keepa.com`):
```
com→1, co.uk→2, de→3, fr→4, co.jp→5, ca→6, it→8, es→9, in→10, com.mx→11, com.br→12
```

**Example**:
```
https://graph.keepa.com/pricehistory.png?asin=B09YNQCQKR&domain=com&amazon=1&new=1&used=1&range=365
```

**Limitations**: Returns a PNG image only (no structured data). Cannot extract actual price numbers from the image without OCR or pixel analysis. Useful for embedding in UIs.

---

## 4. Keepa Browser Extension — Internal Architecture

### 4.1 WebSocket Connection

The extension maintains a **persistent WebSocket connection** to:

```
wss://dyn.keepa.com
```

**Protocol Details**:
- Messages are **deflate-compressed JSON** (binary WebSocket frames)
- NOT encrypted beyond TLS — can be decoded with:
  ```javascript
  pako.inflate(atob(base64Message), { to: "string" });
  // Returns JSON like: {"status": 108, "n": 71}
  ```
- Connection includes unique user identifier (survives browser data clears AND extension reinstalls; must do both to reset)
- Identifier stored both in extension storage and as a cookie on keepa.com

### 4.2 Data Collection on Amazon Pages

When you visit an Amazon product page, the extension sends:

```json
{
  "payload": [null],
  "scrapedData": {"tld": "de"},
  "ratings": [{"rating": "4,3", "ratingCount": "2.924", "asin": "B0719M4YZB"}],
  "key": "f1",
  "domainId": 3
}
```

On search result pages, `ratings` contains one entry per search result.

### 4.3 Keepa Box Injection

The extension injects an iframe into Amazon product pages:

**Current URL**: `https://keepa.com/keepaBox.html#{domainId}-{mode}-{ASIN}`
**Legacy URL**: `https://keepa.com/iframe_addon.html#{domainId}-{mode}-{ASIN}`

Example: `https://keepa.com/keepaBox.html#3-0-B07FCMBLV6`

The Keepa Box is "mostly independent of the extension" — the extension merely assists it by handling some messages.

### 4.4 Extension Scraping Mechanism

The content script accepts scraping instructions via `window.postMessage()`:

```javascript
window.addEventListener("message", function(event) {
  if (event.source == window.parent && event.data) {
    var instructions = event.data.value;
    if ("data" == event.data.key && instructions.url == document.location) {
      scrape(instructions, function(scrapeResult) {
        window.parent.postMessage({ sandbox: scrapeResult }, "*");
      });
    }
  }
});
```

The server can send scraping directives containing URLs, CSS selectors, and regex patterns. The extension can:
- Load Amazon pages in background frames
- Modify security headers via `chrome.webRequest.onBeforeSendHeaders.addListener`
- Execute arbitrary JavaScript in Amazon tabs via `chrome.tabs.executeScript`

**Security note**: Keepa 3.88+ checks message origin; only messages from extension pages are accepted.

### 4.5 Key Takeaway for Extension API

The extension does NOT use different API endpoints than the documented API. It uses:
1. `wss://dyn.keepa.com` for real-time coordination/scraping tasks
2. `https://keepa.com/keepaBox.html` for the injected price chart (client-side rendered)
3. Standard ASIN-based lookups through keepa.com infrastructure

The extension's price charts are rendered client-side from data loaded within the keepaBox iframe — not via separate API calls that could be intercepted for structured data.

---

## 5. RSS Feeds

Keepa provides RSS feeds for price watch notifications:

- Available in your Keepa account settings
- Feed URL is per-user (contains your account identifier)
- Can be consumed by feed readers, Zapier, Discord bots, etc.
- Format: Standard RSS/XML with price alert entries
- **Does NOT provide raw price history data** — only triggered alerts

Usage with Zapier:
1. Get your RSS feed URL from Keepa account
2. Create Zapier trigger: "New Item in Feed"
3. Route to Discord/Slack/email

---

## 6. Product Viewer / CSV Export

- **Quota**: 24,000 ASINs/day import+export (with paid subscription)
- **Replenishes**: 5% per hour
- **No separate API endpoint** — this is a website feature, not a programmable API
- Can upload up to 10,000 ASINs via CSV/text file for batch tracking
- Export available as CSV from the website interface
- **Cannot be automated programmatically** without browser automation

---

## 7. Pricing & Token Tiers

| Plan | Price | Tokens/min | Products/hour | Products/day |
|------|-------|------------|---------------|--------------|
| Basic | ~19/mo (with Keepa sub) | 1 | 60 | 1,440 |
| API Starter | ~49/mo | 20 | 1,200 | 28,800 |
| Higher tiers | Up to ~53,500/mo | Higher | Higher | Higher |

Token costs per endpoint:
- `/product` (basic): 1 token per ASIN
- `/product` (with offers): +2 tokens per ASIN
- `/product` (live data): +1 token
- `/deal`: variable (per page)
- `/graphimage`: 1 token (cached 90 min, re-request free)
- `/bestsellers`: 1 token
- `/category`: 1 token
- `/token`: 0 tokens (free)
- `/lightningdeal`: variable

---

## 8. Alternative Data Extraction Approaches

### 8.1 graph.keepa.com (FREE, no auth)

Best option for visual-only price data:
```
https://graph.keepa.com/pricehistory.png?asin=B09YNQCQKR&domain=com&amazon=1&new=1&used=1
```
- No API key needed
- Returns PNG image
- Useful for UI embedding
- Cannot extract structured data without OCR

### 8.2 RSS Feed + Automation

- Set up Keepa price watches via website
- Use RSS feed URL with Zapier/n8n/custom script
- Only provides alert notifications, not price history

### 8.3 Deal Endpoint Abuse Prevention

Keepa explicitly designs their system to "deter extensive data scraping" with:
- Token expiration (1 hour)
- Daily quotas on Product Viewer
- IP-based rate limiting
- Token costs per request

### 8.4 Scraping keepa.com Directly

NOT recommended:
- Website is fully client-side rendered (SPA with WebSocket)
- All data loaded via WebSocket to `dyn.keepa.com`
- Messages are deflate-compressed binary
- Would need to reverse-engineer the full WebSocket protocol

### 8.5 CamelCamelCamel as Free Alternative

- Completely free price history and alerts
- No public API
- Browser extension available
- Less granular than Keepa (no hourly updates, no sales rank)

## 9. Tested Results & Practical Recommendations

### 9.1 Verified Working (2026-04-13)

| Endpoint | Works? | Token Cost | Notes |
|----------|--------|------------|-------|
| `/token` | YES | 0 | Free balance check |
| `/product` | YES | 1/ASIN | Batch up to 100. Returns full CSV price history |
| `/deal` | YES | 5/page | titleSearch="flashlight" returns 150 deals (3P New). Amazon price type returns 0. Noisy — includes cases, fans, watches |
| `/tracking` add | YES | 1 | Format: `notificationType: [false,false,false,false,false,true,false,false]` (index 5=API). Only works for ASINs in Keepa's product DB (our scraped ASINs qualify) |
| `/tracking` remove | YES | 0 | GET with `asin` + `mainDomainId` params |
| `/tracking` list | YES | 0 | Shows active trackings |

### 9.2 Verified NOT Working

| Endpoint | Issue |
|----------|-------|
| `graph.keepa.com` (free) | Returns "no price history available" for ALL our flashlight ASINs. Only works for products Keepa has independently tracked on their website/extension — not API-only products |
| `/graphimage` (1 token) | Same result — "no price history". Even though `/product` returns CSV data, graph generation requires Keepa's own tracking history |
| `/deal` with `priceTypes: [0]` (Amazon) | 0 results for flashlights. Amazon-price drops are rare. `priceTypes: [1]` (3P New) returns 150 |
| CFC browser on keepa.com | Extension not connected during testing |

### 9.3 Key Insights

1. **Graph endpoints are useless for us** — our products are API-discovered only, not website-tracked. Both free and paid graph endpoints require Keepa's own crawl history.
2. **We already have the best data** — our `/product` API scraping gets the actual CSV price arrays, which we use for sparklines and deal scoring. No external graph needed.
3. **`/deal` is expensive and noisy** — 5 tokens/page, results mix non-flashlight items, no good category filter. Our own deals-feed.ts is more accurate.
4. **Tracking is viable** — 1 token per ASIN, works for our scraped products. With webhook, could push price alerts. But monitoring ~6800 ASINs = 6800 tokens = ~4.7 days at 1/min.
5. **Best token strategy**: Continue using `/product` for batch scraping (1 token/ASIN, 100/batch) + tiered refresh of stale deal candidates via cron.

### 9.4 Practical Recommendations

Given 1/min refill (60/hour, 1440/day):

1. **Keep current pipeline** — our own scraping + deal scoring is the most token-efficient and accurate approach
2. **Tiered refresh** (already implemented) — prioritize refreshing deal candidates over bulk scraping
3. **Consider tracking for top 50 deal products** — 50 tokens one-time, get API notifications on price drops
4. **Skip `/deal` endpoint** — 5 tokens/page, noisy results, not worth the cost
5. **Skip graph endpoints** — don't work for our products. Our SVG sparklines are better anyway
